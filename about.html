							I enjoy learning, working on myself through reflection exercises, community gatherings and conversations. I seek support when I sense that I need to be heard. I imagine creating enough spaciousness inside myself to have space to support a child, to nurture and care for one while also caring for myself. I am doing a small part of this now by caring for my grandmother.<br><br>
							I also make a conscious attempt to choose words that I use to express myself with, both when speaking and writing. I recently discovered through my practice of Yoga and by noticing changes in my body that “Life is dynamic and I have the power to contribute to it’s dynamism”. This loving reminder helps me feel empowered to make choices, and act on them. <br><br>
							I’ve trained in Psychology through my college years, and enjoyed it. My learning grew immensely once I got introduced to Non-violent communication. It showed me that I can look at a client as a fellow human being and bring my whole self to connect with them, instead of holding a position of an expert, which separates me from them. It freed me from the fear of being a mental health professional and being unable to express my needs to a fellow human; instead it showed me that I can openly express what’s alive in me as well.<br><br>
							Through my own awareness and practices, I’ve begun to understand and see how I can support others and add value to people’s lives by being present for them and helping them stay with their experience to see what emerges. <br><br>
							In my work so far, I’ve worked with schools and colleges, teaching Psychology, and as a Counsellor. I’ve also worked in groups and one-on-one with several children, parents and individual adults (and have been told “I am easy to talk to!” and that “I don’t arrive at a conclusion and give advice; instead I listen”).<br><br>
							I would love to work with you.<br><br>
