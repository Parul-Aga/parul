								<h3> Workshop on Non Violent Communication: </h3>
								<ul><em>
									<li>Do you find yourself in situations where it’s difficult for you to make choices that are in sync with your personal values?</li>

							</ul><p style="margin:0">
								Nonviolent Communication (NVC) guides us to reframe the way we express ourselves and
								 listen to others. It invites us to focus our consciousness on four areas: what we observe,
								  feel, need and request. It helps us transform blame & judgment- where neither our own needs
									nor those of the other person are likely to be met- into a space where mutually everyone’s needs matter.
									NVC encourages deep listening, respect, empathy and creates a mutual desire to give from the heart.	<br> <br>
									<strong>Age group:</strong>  can be customized for middle and senior school students, as well as parents, adults in school settings, corporate settings, NGO’s, families or any other setting.
									<br><strong>Interactive workshop</strong> with games, activities (in pairs, small groups) and group discussions.
									<br>Get in touch with me to conduct this workshop in your school, or in your workplace.
